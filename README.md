# First-Portfolio 

## Description

This project is the beginning of my bootcamp portfolio. I will use this project to show case my portofolio works from my bootcamp experience. 
To create this portfolio I used HTML5, CSS and Javascript. 

HTML5 was used to create the layout of the webpage along with my different sections. CSS was used to style each section and to create css varaibles for global changes. Javascript was used to create a side menu for smaller displays for easy navigation.
